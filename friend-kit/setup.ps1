# Dauntless Revived - one-time setup for a friend's PC.
#
# Checks the game files, installs the two server DLLs, registers your account on the
# host's server and saves your personal key. Safe to run again: it never registers twice
# and only copies a DLL when it is missing or wrong.

# -Server    the host's Tailscale address (the host tells you), optionally with :port
# -Game      the folder that contains Archon\ (default C:\D144\Dauntless)
# -Zip       optional: the downloaded game zip, to check it before you extract it
# -Username  3-16 letters, digits or _   (asked for if missing)
# -Invite    the invite code from the host (asked for if missing)
# -NoMods    skip installing UE4SS and the client mods (client-mods\, see its README.md)
